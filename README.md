# FlyP
FlyP - Pen on Fly.

In this project we are proposing a mobile navigation mechanism by establishing communication between pen and digital screen. 

KALOS Navigation Pen, FlyP is used to write in any medium that will reflect the writings on the computer/mobile screen. It should happen wired or wireless. 

For example, it should work like a navigation system we have in pre operation planning for ablation devices.
